<h2 align="center">This App Contains the Logic of a SPA+REST Api</h2>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my **Small-Fullstack-App** I implement the Logic of Both **Frontend** and **Backend parts** of a **Modern Web Application**. It has a dynamic **Frontend** part that sends a fetch requests to **Create**, **Read**, **Update** and **Delete** a **Resource** from the **REST Api** without **Reloading the Page**. The **REST Api** sends the **Data** to the **Frontend** in a **JSON** format and the **Frontend** does its **Logic** with it.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Application has a 'Mocking DB' (the Data is stored in the Memory of the **REST Api**) with three Products initially in it. The user can **Create** more **Products**, **Load(READ)** all Products and see them on the Page, **Edit(UPDATE)** a single Item and **DELETE it**. All this **Interactions** are made with the **Client Javascript on the Frontend**, rather than with the **Browser's Default Behaviour via Forms**. 
The **Submit Button** in the Form is Interactive and Changes its Text and Logic, depending on the user's choice whether to **Edit(UPDATE)** a Product or **CREATE** one more.
